# Unity-Animation-Script
Soldier's animations scripts

This script was made more than 2 years ago.
Unity has evolved and now has a better Animation system.
We only have to set the state machine parameters.
There is also a blend tree that do the job visualy instead of coding everything like we had to do before.
